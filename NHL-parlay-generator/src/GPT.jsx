For Alex Ovechkin, with a history of goal-scoring and his role on the power play, the *Over 0.5 Goals* might also be a favorable choice, especially if the opposing defense is weaker or if he has been in good form recently. Between the two, both picks have merit, but the *Over 0.5 Goals for Ovechkin* may statistically have a slightly higher probability of being correct given his scoring consistency.");
